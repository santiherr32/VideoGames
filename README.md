Henry Videogames Club is a SPA devloped with React, that uses technologies like React/Redux for the front-end and NodeJS + Express and Sequelize + PostgreSQL for the back-end. This app allows users to browse through a gallery of videogames, consuming from the RAWG Api. The videogames gallery supports pagination, sorting by alphabetical order or rating and filtering by multiple genres. Also, supports searching for videogames available in the app. Finally, enables the creation of their own videogames through a controlled form that stores data on a database.
